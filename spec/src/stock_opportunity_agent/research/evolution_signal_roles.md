# Evolution Signal Roles

## Purpose

Implement structured adapters for deterministic/LLM Signal execution, Signal
mining, and Signal update proposals.

## Invariants

- Candidate execution is evidence-backed and cannot promote a Signal.
- Mining and update output remains bounded by the frozen contract.
- Promotion authority stays in the Slow engine after machine validation.
